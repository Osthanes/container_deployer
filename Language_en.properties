ExtName=IBM Containers on Bluemix
ExtDesc=Provides a set of default deployment patterns for containers on the IBM Containers service. Containers are typically built using the Docker Builder, and images are stored in the tenant's Container Registry.
ExtMessage=For information and a quick-start guide view our <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_single_pipeline_ov.html#container_single_pipeline_deploy" target="_blank">documentation</a> or try one of our example projects and pipelines found on <a href="https://github.com/Puquios" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  

CONTAINER_NAME_KEY=Name
CONTAINER_NAME_DESC=The base name of the container or group that will be started. This can also be set on the stage environment.
COMMAND_KEY=Deployer script
COMMAND_DESC=Default script used to start a container.

DEPLOY_TYPE_KEY=Deployment strategy
DEPLOY_TYPE_DESC=The type of desired deployment. Currently supports 'red_black' and 'clean'. A 'red_black' deployment will deploy a new version of the application, and if successful will re-route the IP address or Cloud Foundry Route to that version then remove the previous version. A 'clean' deployment will remove previous versions of the application.  
PORT_KEY=PORT
PORT_DESC=Published port(s) for the container or container group. If you want to expose more than a single port, use a comma as a delimiter. For example, '80,443' exposes both port 80 and port 443.
ARGS_KEY=Optional deploy arguments
ARGS_DESC=Extra arguments to pass to the deployment command. For example, to expose "varname=somevalue" and "some_other_var=other_value" environment variables in the container, update the value of this parameter to "--env varname=somevalue --env some_other_var=other_value".
